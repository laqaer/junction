"""Harness-router dispatch for task-runner steps.

Opt-in: a run routes its steps only when routing.json's ``route_tasks`` is on
(or the start request asked for it), fixed on the run when it first executes.
Otherwise every step runs on the configured agent, exactly as before.

A routed step asks the router for the best lane for its kind, runs on that
lane's harness (and model), and reports the outcome to the routing ledger, so a
usage limit hit by one step rests that lane for every later step, subagent and
run. The rules mirror routed subagents (``SubagentManager._run_accounted``):

* A step keeps its lane while its conversation lives: a retry after an ordinary
  failure (tests red, a review issue) stays on the same agent.
* A lane-level failure (usage or rate limit, sign-in, missing harness, a silent
  stall) releases the lane, so the next attempt goes to the next best one.
  Before any tool ran that move is free (the attempt is not counted), up to
  ``max_failover`` free hops per step; after a tool ran it costs an attempt,
  since the step already changed the workspace.
* Initially no eligible lane (every one resting, none installed) falls back to
  the configured agent. Once a step has encountered a lane failure, exhaustion
  fails the step instead of retrying a cooling harness without lane accounting.
  A hard daily-cap refusal also fails closed on initial selection.
* A step's lane outlives the process. The executor writes the lane (and its
  model, or the configured-agent fallback) onto the task before each dispatch,
  and a paused or crash-recovered step restores exactly that lane
  (``StepRoute.for_task``) instead of re-scoring headroom that its own earlier
  dispatch already reduced. A saved lane that is gone, disabled, uninstalled,
  re-pointed at another harness, resting or at its daily cap refuses the resume
  rather than moving a half-done step to another provider. The restored lane may
  already have changed the workspace, so its first lane-level failure is never a
  free move.
