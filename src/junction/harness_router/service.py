"""One object every surface uses: gateway, CLI, and subagent dispatch.

``HarnessRouter`` resolves a *target* (``route``, a lane id, or a harness name)
into a concrete lane, records dispatches and outcomes in the ledger, and picks
the next lane when one fails at the lane level. It holds no per-caller state:
settings are re-read when ``routing.json`` changes, and the installed-harness
probe is cached briefly because it walks ``PATH``.
