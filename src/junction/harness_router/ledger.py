"""Usage ledger: what each lane has done recently, and which lanes are resting.

The router spreads work by *observed* usage, so it needs a record that
survives restarts and is shared by every process that dispatches (the
gateway, ``warding route run``). The ledger is one small JSON file under the
data home, rewritten atomically under an advisory lock. It holds timestamps,
counters, per-lane event sequence numbers and a truncated, credential-redacted
last error — never prompts or keys.

All methods are synchronous file I/O. Call them from async code through
``asyncio.to_thread``.
