"""Pick the lane for one unit of work.

The objective is *maximum useful work from what the operator already pays
for*:

1. **Spend flat-rate quota first.** A subscription's unused window is lost at
   reset, so subscription and free lanes outrank metered ones unless the
   metered lane is clearly better at the task.
2. **Spread load by headroom.** Each lane's usage in its rolling window is
   compared with its capacity (``window_limit`` when stated, else ``weight``
   times a nominal allowance). A lane near its cap yields to one with room, so
   no plan hits its limit while another sits idle.
3. **Match the task.** Affinity for the task kind (plan, implement, review, …)
   decides between lanes with similar headroom.
4. **Route around trouble.** A lane resting after a usage limit, rate limit or
   failed login is skipped until its reset; a metered lane past its daily cap
   is skipped outright.

Scoring is pure over (lanes, ledger snapshot, installed set) so it is cheap,
deterministic and testable without spawning anything.
