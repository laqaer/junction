"""Compose harness + model plane status into one Junction snapshot.

The two planes already have owners (``acp.runtimes`` and ``model_router``).
This module does not spawn agents, probe non-loopback hosts, or change the
Kiro harness path. It is a read-only join so CLI, doctor, and the dashboard
share one payload: harness inventory, model-plane health, and the role DAG.
