"""Tailnet mobile access: the guided path from this laptop to a phone.

The dashboard already had every *piece* of tailnet access — :mod:`junction.
dashboard.tailnet` resolves the MagicDNS name, :mod:`junction.dashboard.
tailnet_serve` publishes and withdraws ``tailscale serve``, and the CLI wires
them together as ``junction tailnet up`` — and no way to get there from the UI.
An operator who wanted the dashboard on their phone had to know that Tailscale
existed, install it, sign in, find a config switch in a Security panel, restart
the gateway, run a CLI verb, and then mint a token by hand. Each step failed
with a message about the step, never about the sequence.

This module is the sequence. It answers one question — *what is the single next
thing to do?* — and it answers it as a **step**, not as a pile of booleans the
frontend has to re-derive. That is deliberate for the same reason
:func:`junction.dashboard.handlers.tailnet._derive_state` gives: one owner for
the state machine, so the card and the backend cannot disagree about what a host
with a name but no published serve means.

Three properties are load-bearing.

**This is a LIVE probe, and the existing status endpoint is not.**
``GET /api/tailnet/status`` deliberately reports the value resolved once at
startup, because that is what actually went into the fixed origin allowlist.
This endpoint reports what the machine can do *next*. The two must stay separate:
a name that resolves now but was absent at startup is exactly the boot race where
the origin is NOT trusted, and reporting it as ready would be the
"checked-but-never-ran shown as a clean result" defect. It gets its own step
(``restart_gateway``) instead. The one-click UI resumes after the replacement
gateway is ready, while the security boundary itself changes only at startup.

**The QR carries a live credential, so it is minted on demand and never cached.**
The payload is a URL with a session token in its query string. It is not logged,
not stored, and not returned by the status endpoint — only by an explicit POST.
Behind ``tailscale serve`` every request reaches the gateway from ``127.0.0.1``,
so per-device session pinning cannot distinguish the phone from anything else on
the tailnet (issue #1762): the token is the only real credential, which is why
the default TTL here is an hour rather than the 20-hour ceiling the CLI uses.

**Publishing is the consent for staying awake.** A phone loses the dashboard the
moment the laptop idles, so a published tailnet dashboard keeps the SYSTEM awake
(the display may still sleep). Enabling mobile access is the opt-in;
``dashboard.tailscale.keep_awake`` exists to opt back out of the awake half
without unpublishing.

       nothing below is actionable, and offering a toggle would be a lie.
    2. ``install`` / ``start_daemon`` / ``sign_in`` / ``enable_magicdns`` — the

       Tailscale", "start it", "sign in" and "turn MagicDNS on" are four
       different errands.

       certificate provisioning for it. This is a tailnet-wide administrator
       consent and cannot safely be performed by a gateway process.

       only by the formal gateway restart path.

       dashboard, or its state could not be determined. Publishing would REPLACE
       it, so this refuses and the card renders the manual command
       (``junction tailnet up``) for the operator to run deliberately.

    THREE independent gates. The owner gate is the load-bearing one.

    **Dashboard-user only.** ``request["app"]`` is set by the auth middleware on
    every authenticated path — ``""`` for a dashboard user, the app name for an
    app token — so anything else is refused. An app token is admitted by the
    middleware for whatever path prefixes its manifest ``permissions.api``
    declares, and ``_is_restricted_session`` cannot stop it: that predicate reads
    ``X-Session-Key``, which an app token does not carry, so it answers "not
    restricted". An ABSENT key is refused too: it means the middleware never ran.

    **Owner only.** Being a dashboard user is NOT enough, because a dashboard user
    is not necessarily *this* dashboard's owner. Telegram, Teams and Slack all
    hand a presigned dashboard link to any ALLOWED user, minting a token whose
    ``sub`` is that user's own id (``telegram/transport_dispatch``,
    ``teams/transport_dispatch``) — so a non-owner can legitimately hold a
    dashboard session. The QR endpoint mints ``generate_token(owner_id or
    "local-app")``, i.e. an OWNER-subject credential, and ``local-app`` is itself
    in ``_LOCAL_DASHBOARD_OWNER_SUBJECTS``. Without this gate any allowed
    messaging user could trade their own scoped session for an owner one — a
    privilege escalation, not merely an over-broad surface. ``core.py``'s
    identical mint is gated by loopback + a local-secret HMAC; this endpoint is
    reachable over the tailnet, so it needs the owner claim instead.
    ``is_owner_dashboard_request`` is reused rather than re-derived: a second copy
    of an authorization predicate is how one path comes to be guarded and its

    # refresh chain IS issued, so being idle no longer signs the phone out, and
    # both the access cookie and the chain carry the boot id, so a restart does.
    # This is the default because it matches what handing a phone a QR code
    # actually means: signed in while my gateway is up. A clock the operator
    # cannot see, which signs the phone out mid-use and yet keeps working after
    # the gateway is gone, matches nothing anyone asked for.
    #
    # It is a DIFFERENT bound, not a strictly tighter one: a gateway with long
    # uptime grants a correspondingly long session. What keeps that honest is
    # that the bound is something the operator can see and act on — `uptime`
    # answers "is my phone still signed in", and a restart is a hard revoke
    # needing no recorded state. The peer pin, the revocation counter and
    # `junction logout` all still apply unchanged.
    #
    # Opt out — ``no_refresh``: no refresh chain is issued at the exchange, so
    # ``session_exp`` becomes a real ceiling and the phone re-scans when it
    # lapses. Kept as a supported shape for an operator who wants the credential
    # bounded by a clock regardless of process lifetime.
    #
    # Mutually exclusive on purpose: carrying both would mean a session that
    # neither refreshes nor lasts, which is worse than either.
    #
    # The TTL clamp above is untouched under both shapes. Rotation is what
    # extends a boot-bound session, so no ceiling and no security constant moves.
    # Read the session-shape choice here rather than widening ``_live_state``'s
    # tuple, which the status endpoint also consumes.
    #
    # An unreadable config falls back to the DEFAULT, not to the other shape.
    # "We could not read your override, so use the default" is the honest
    # reading; picking the timed shape instead would hand the phone a session
    # that expires on a clock the operator did not ask for, which presents as a
    # phone that randomly signs itself out. The fallback is not unbounded
    # either — a boot-bound session still ends at the next restart.
