# Harness router — send each task to the subscription that should do it

**This is the change-control contract for `src/junction/harness_router/`.**
Read it before changing that package, the `harness` / `kind` fields on
`spawn_run`, or the per-session `acp_backend_override` factory seam. Update it
in the same commit when behavior documented here changes.

Junction docks several coding-agent harnesses at once — Claude Code, Codex
(ChatGPT), Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode (OpenRouter and every other provider it
logs into), and the rest of the registry in `acp/runtimes.py`. Each is reached
through a plan or account the operator already pays for. The harness router
decides which one takes each unit of work. It **chooses a harness**; it never
forwards provider traffic, stores a key, or reads a harness's credentials. The
chosen harness runs with its own login, exactly as `agent.acp_backend` would.

Related: [harness-parity](harness-parity.md) (what an added harness may and may
not change), [model-router](model-router.md) (the model plane, which this does
not touch), [subagent](subagent.md) (where routed work runs), [mcp](../../architecture/mcp.md).

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Harness** | An ACP backend id from `acp/types.py`, spelled for operators (`kiro` for the empty backend). |
| **Lane** | One subscription or account reached through one harness: `id`, `harness`, `billing`, `weight`, `window_hours`, `window_limit`, `daily_limit`, optional `model`, per-kind `affinity`. Two lanes may share a harness (an OpenCode lane on a cheap OpenRouter model for bulk work, another on a strong one for review). |
| **Kind** | What the work is: `plan`, `implement`, `debug`, `review`, `test`, `research`, `docs`, `quick`, `bulk` (`kinds.TASK_KINDS`). The orchestrating LLM names it as an enum; the router never guesses it from free text. |
| **Billing** | `subscription` (flat plan with a usage window), `free`, or `metered` (pay per token). |
| **Ledger** | `<data home>/routing/ledger.json`: per-lane dispatch timestamps, outcome counters, cooldown deadline, and a truncated, credential-redacted last error. Never prompts or keys. |

## Objective

Maximum useful work from what the operator already pays for:

1. **Spend flat-rate quota first.** Unused subscription quota is lost at reset,
   so metered lanes compete at `METERED_FACTOR` (0.6) of their score.
2. **Spread load by headroom.** A lane's dispatches in its rolling window are
   compared with its capacity (`window_limit` when stated, else `weight ×
   NOMINAL_WINDOW_DISPATCHES`). A lane near its cap yields to one with room.
3. **Match the task.** Affinity for the kind decides between lanes with similar
   headroom.
4. **Route around trouble.** A lane resting after a lane-level failure is
   excluded until its cooldown ends; a lane past `daily_limit` is excluded; a
   lane at `window_limit` falls behind every lane with room (`EXHAUSTED_FACTOR`)
   but is not excluded, since a stated limit may be conservative.

`score = billing_factor × (0.6 × affinity + 0.4 × headroom)` (+ a small bonus
for a caller's `prefer`). Scoring (`router.decide`) is pure over settings,
ledger snapshot and the installed set, so it is deterministic and testable
without spawning anything. Ties break by lane order in `routing.json`.

Default affinities live in `profiles.HARNESS_PROFILES`: Claude Code leads plan,
review and docs; Codex leads implement, debug and test; Grok leads research;
Cursor leads quick edits; OpenCode is metered and favours bulk. They are a
starting point for a zero-config install, not a benchmark — `routing.json`
overrides any of them per lane.

## Lanes and `routing.json`

`<data home>/routing.json` holds `enabled`, `max_failover` (default 2) and a
`lanes` list. It carries no credentials. With no file, every installed harness
becomes one lane with its built-in profile (`source: "auto"`), and that set
tracks installs without a restart. A present-but-unparseable file degrades to
the detected lanes with a warning: routing is never the reason a gateway cannot
start. Invalid lanes are skipped with a warning, never guessed at. `junction
route init` writes a template from the installed harnesses.

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "max_failover": 2,
  "lanes": [
    {"id": "claude-max", "harness": "claude", "billing": "subscription", "weight": 3},
    {"id": "chatgpt-pro", "harness": "codex", "billing": "subscription", "weight": 3},
    {"id": "cursor-pro", "harness": "cursor", "billing": "subscription"},
    {"id": "supergrok", "harness": "grok", "billing": "subscription"},
    {"id": "openrouter", "harness": "opencode", "billing": "metered",
     "model": "openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4", "daily_limit": 200}
  ]
}
```

A lane's `model` is spelled for **its own harness** and is sent only to that
harness (H12). A routed subagent never inherits `agent.role_models.subagent`,
which is spelled for the configured default harness.

## Failure classes and cooldowns (`limits.py`)

| Class | Examples | Rest when no reset is stated |
|---|---|---|
| `usage_limit` | "usage limit reached", "5-hour limit", "Insufficient credits" | 60 min |
| `rate_limit` | 429, "rate limit", "overloaded", `AcpTurnStalled` (a harness silent while retrying its provider) | 2 min |
| `auth` | `AcpAuthRequired`, "Authentication required", "run /login" | 30 min |
| `unavailable` | harness binary missing, "is not installed" | 10 min |
| `other` | an ordinary task failure | none — it would fail on any lane |

A stated reset ("try again in 2 hours 5 minutes", "resets 3pm", Claude's
`|<epoch>` suffix) wins over the default, clamped to `[30 s, 8 days]`. Clock
times are read in the host's local zone. A success clears a lane's cooldown.

Some harnesses end a turn normally with the limit notice as the whole reply.
`limit_notice_failure` treats a reply as a lane failure only when it is short
(`LIMIT_NOTICE_MAX_CHARS`), classifies as `usage_limit` or `auth` (never
`rate_limit`, which an ordinary answer about rate limiting mentions), and the
turn ran no tools.

## Dispatch

### Subagents (`spawn_run`)

`spawn_run` takes `harness` (batch-wide) or `harnesses[]` (one per task), and
`kind` / `kinds[]`. `harness` is `route` (the router picks), a lane id, or a
harness name. The gateway's `POST /api/spawn` resolves it **before** the
submission is counted, so a refusal is an ordinary 400 with a `code`. The
response carries `route` (lane, harness, model, kind, routed, reason).

`SubagentInfo` gains `harness`, `lane`, `route_kind`, `routed`. In `_run_inner`
a set `harness` becomes the factory kwarg `acp_backend_override` and forces the
dedicated-process path (the parent's shared runtime is a different harness).
`state.json` persists `harness` and `lane`, and `continue_conversation`
continues on them: a conversation lives in the harness that ran it.

`SubagentManager._run_accounted` wraps `_run_inner` for a run with a lane:

- records a dispatch, then the outcome, in the ledger;
- on a lane-level failure of a **routed** run with no tool activity, not a
  continuation, not user-stopped, and within `max_failover` hops, tears the
  session down and re-runs on `router.next_lane(kind, tried)`, firing
  `subagent_retrying` with `{lane, harness, failed_lane}` and a
  `subagent.harness_failover` SEL record;
- an explicit pin (`routed=False`) never moves; its failure still rests the lane.

A run with no lane passes straight through: the unrouted path is unchanged.

### The provider-factory seam

`JunctionConfig.create_provider_factory()`'s closure takes an optional
`acp_backend_override`. Absent, the configured `agent.acp_backend` is used
exactly as before. Present, `resolve_acp_backend_override` maps `kiro` to `""`
and **raises** on an unknown value — an override is an explicit per-call choice,
and running a different harness than the one named is what H3/H8 forbid. The
warm pool is bypassed with decision `bypass_harness`: pooled processes run the
configured backend and a claim only re-keys and re-models them.

### Terminal (`junction route run`)

Runs one prompt on the resolved lane with the same failover rules, streaming to
stdout. Tool permission requests are asked at the terminal when both ends are a
TTY, else denied (`--no-prompt` forces deny). It warms the sandbox probe before
the event loop starts, because the probe never runs on a live loop.

## Connecting harnesses (`connect.py`)

Junction never performs a sign-in and never sees a credential. "Connecting" an
agent means running that agent's own login command, then probing it.

- `HARNESS_SETUP` holds the install and login shell commands and a docs URL for
  the featured subscriptions (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode).
  Claude's install names `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` too: Junction
  drives Claude Code through that adapter, which the `claude` CLI does not ship.
  Other registry harnesses show their runtime `login_hint` instead.
- `probe_harness` starts the harness exactly as a session would (provider
  factory, sandboxed, `acp_backend_override`) and runs `initialize` +
  `session/new`. **No prompt is sent, so a probe spends no plan quota.** The
  outcome is one of `connected`, `needs_login`, `not_installed` (including a
  missing adapter), `timeout`, `error`, and is persisted with a redacted,
  truncated detail and the models the harness advertised (`advertised`, its own
  ids, at most `PROBE_MODELS_MAX`) in `<data home>/routing/harnesses.json`.
  `junction route check` and the dashboard share it.
- `service.check_harness` (probe now) and `service.verified_connection` (reuse a
  `connected` probe younger than `max_age_secs`, else probe) hold one lock per
  harness, so a double-clicked Check or a burst of gated requests starts one
  process. The dashboard's readiness gate uses the latter; see below.
- Settings ▸ **Agents & plans** (`website/src/pages/settings/AgentsPanel.tsx`)
  renders one card per agent: status, Install / Sign in (typed into the
  dashboard's dock terminal, or copied when the terminal is off), Check, and the
  lane controls (use for routing, billing, plan size, window limit, model),
  plus the current pick per kind. On first load it probes every installed agent
  that was never checked. Every displayed word is a catalog key; commands and
  statuses are machine data.
- The first-run gate shows the same panel in compact form above the Kiro steps,
  with **Continue with these agents** once any agent is connected
  (`POST /api/kiro-prerequisite/complete-with-agents`). kiro-cli is optional.

## The dashboard on a non-Kiro agent

The session manager resolves the harness new dashboard turns run on
(`SessionManager.resolved_backend()`: `agent.acp_backend` with `auto` resolved
through `acp.runtimes.resolve_backend`, cached for 60 s). Everything that used to
assume kiro-cli reads it:

| Surface | kiro-cli / KAS | Any other agent |
|---|---|---|
| Regenerate, edit-resend, rewind, `/v1/chat/completions` | Kiro prerequisite gate | `verified_connection` (5 min, 45 s budget); 503 `harness_not_connected` unless `connected` |
| `/api/models` | `kiro-cli --list-models` | that agent's advertised models: newest live session, else last probe; `auto` first; 503 `harness_models_pending` while neither exists |
| `/api/sessions/usage` | Kiro credit scrape | `{"available": false, "reason": "harness_not_kiro"}` (pill hidden) |
| Task runner steps | shared `AcpRuntime` | one dedicated provider per step on the configured agent |
| Background one-liners | `_bg` runtime session | provider-backed `_ProviderBgSession` |

Membership is `ACP_BACKENDS_KIRO_READINESS` (gates) and
`ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME` (runtime hosting), both positive sets (H5/H6). An
unreadable active backend answers kiro-cli, which keeps the fail-closed Kiro
gate.

## Surfaces

| Surface | What |
|---|---|
| `junction route` / `route status [--json]` | Lanes, windows, 24h use, cooldowns and last error, current pick per kind |
| `junction route pick KIND` | Rank every lane for a kind (twin of `route_task`) |
| `junction route run [-k KIND] [--harness T] PROMPT` | One prompt on the routed lane, with failover |
| `junction route check [LANE…]` | Start each harness once (initialize + session/new): installed? logged in? |
| `junction route init [--force] [--all]` | Write `routing.json` from the installed harnesses |
| `junction route clear [LANE]` | Lift a cooldown early |
| MCP `route_task(kind, prefer?)` | Read-only ranking for the orchestrating agent |
| MCP `spawn_run(harness, harnesses[], kind, kinds[])` | Routed or pinned dispatch |
| `GET /api/routing/status` | Same payload as `route status --json` |
| `GET /api/routing/decide?kind=&role=&prefer=&exclude=` | One decision; "no lane" is a 200 with `code: no_lane` |
| `POST /api/routing/cooldown/clear {lane?}` | Lift a cooldown |
| `GET /api/routing/harnesses` | Every connectable agent: installed, last probe, setup commands, its lane, picks per kind |
| `POST /api/routing/harnesses/{harness}/check` | Probe one agent now (one at a time per agent) and record the result |
| `PUT /api/routing/harnesses/{harness}/lane` | Edit that agent's lane (`enabled`, `billing`, `weight`, `window_limit`, `daily_limit`, `model`) in `routing.json`; `400` `invalid_lane_edit` on a bad value. A missing file is materialized from the detected lanes; a broken one is refused, never overwritten |

`/api/routing` is a mixed internal path (MCP secret or dashboard cookie).
Handlers do their file I/O off the event loop.

## Invariants

1. **Choose, never forward.** No provider traffic, keys, or credential reads.
   OpenRouter reaches Junction as the OpenCode harness logged into it.
2. **Unrouted is unchanged.** No lane ⇒ `_run_inner` directly; no override ⇒
   the configured backend; the Kiro path gains no conditional (H13).
3. **Explicit beats routed.** A named lane or harness never silently moves.
4. **Only lane failures move work, only before activity.** An ordinary task
   failure never rests a lane; a run that executed a tool never re-runs.
5. **Accounting never fails a run.** Ledger and settings errors are logged and
   swallowed; a corrupt ledger starts fresh.
6. **No secrets at rest.** The ledger stores redacted, truncated error text.
