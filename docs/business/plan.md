# Warding — company plan

Built on Amazon's open-source Kiro agent workspace, published under Apache-2.0
in 2026. Most of the code is theirs; the attribution notice is in NOTICE.
Not affiliated with Amazon.

This is the plan the [business team](../../.agents/business/README.md) executes
and the owner decides on. Day 1 is Monday 2026-09-28. Every paid item is
labelled **Available now**, **Pre-order** or **Waitlist**. Every number under
"Metrics" is a scenario, not a forecast: there have been zero customer
conversations. Implementation identifiers stay as their systems spelled them
(`junction` package, `JUNCTION_HOME`, `junction` CLI alias); the product is
Warding.

## 1. One-pager

**Mission.** Let a coding agent keep working when nobody is watching, on
hardware its owner controls, under rules the agent cannot open, and prove it in
public.

**What we sell.** Nothing in the Apache tree, ever. We sell (1) our time to set
the late desk up on your box, (2) a supporter tier with real digital goods,
(3) design-partner pilots that co-build the fleet layer (central policy push,
audit forwarding, SSO), and later (4) the Team companion that ships that layer,
plus (5) a hosted always-on box only if a waitlist proves it. Offers and labels:
[pricing.md](pricing.md).

**To whom.** Free: the developer with an agent subscription and a spare box.
Paid: the platform or security lead who has to say yes to unattended agents and
needs a packet to forward.

**Why now.** Vendors ship single-vendor routines, channels and remote control.
The local parallel-agent GUIs are free and crowded. The chat-reachable personal
agents are huge, and OpenClaw's security record got them banned at companies.
Three startups in the space died in 2026. The corner left is governance,
approvals and always-on self-hosting across agents, and the engine for it
already exists in this tree.

**Why us.** We inherited a mature, heavily tested gateway (dashboard, cron, task
runner, subagents, memory, ten channels, OS sandbox, deny rules, a keystone
policy the agent cannot read or write, an HMAC-chained audit log, POLICY ∩
PROFILE enforced at our own gate, Agent Worlds, 21 apps, 18 themes, 12
languages). We added what the 0.5.0 base lacked and 0.7.1 still lacks in part: a
registry of ten non-Kiro harnesses, five of which upstream does not dock
(Cursor, Kimi, DeepSeek Harness, Grok, Droid), with kiro-cli optional and last
and no vendor account in the door; a harness router that can send a spawned
subagent to another installed harness (registered, not verified at runtime);
and, in the plan below, the artefacts that
make governance checkable rather than claimed: a rendered charter, a verifiable
audit chain, a public bypass script, a per-OS fail-closed table, dawn-expiring
grants, and a morning report that counts refusals.

**What is true in the tree today.** Claude Code spawns through the ACP
project's `claude-agent-acp` adapter, fetched with `npx` on first run. The
default build contacts no upstream-owned endpoint: beacon silent, update check
skipped, app catalog served from seed and built-ins; the embedding model is still
fetched from a third-party CDN on first use. Upstream vocabulary is gone from the
dashboard strings in all twelve locales. Claude Code is verified for chat only.

**What is not true yet.** A tagged release, a wheel, a one-line install, a
recorded overnight run on any harness, MCP tools on spec-family harnesses (so
cron and subagents from chat, and `ask_question` at all, work on kiro-cli only),
the model picker on non-Kiro harnesses, dawn-expiring grants, the Morning
Report, `warding charter`, `warding audit verify`, the bypass script, the
Supporter deliverables. The base is 0.5.0; upstream is at 0.7.1.

## 2. Why not upstream, and the fork strategy

The first sentence of `/compare/upstream/`: "Same engine as the upstream project.
If you are a kiro-cli user, use upstream: it is ahead (signed installers, wheel,
Docker, 0.6–0.7 features, MCP tools on its Claude, Codex, OpenCode and goose
backends), and we say so." Then what is different, in order of how true it is
today:

1. **No vendor door.** `auto` picks the spec-family CLI you already have;
   kiro-cli is optional and last. First run never asks for a Kiro account.
   Whether upstream requires an account on a non-Kiro backend is unverified;
   say so.
2. **Five harnesses upstream does not dock:** Cursor, Kimi, DeepSeek Harness,
   Grok, Droid. Both dock OpenCode; upstream docks KAS, which we do not; say so.
3. **The default build contacts no upstream server.**
4. **The proof artefacts** `[COMING]`: `warding charter`, `warding audit
   verify`, the public "break the charter" script with a stated bounty, the
   per-OS fail-closed table, and `/verified`. Upstream has the engine; we
   publish the test.
5. **Two mechanisms upstream is structurally unlikely to ship** `[COMING]`:
   dawn-expiring, session-scoped approval grants, and the Morning Report that
   counts commands refused and secrets redacted from the audit log.

Where we have no answer and say so: install polish, Docker, signed installers,
KAS, and MCP tools on non-Kiro harnesses. Upstream ships the same
ten channels; we inherited them.

**Strategy: track upstream, rebase quarterly, contribute the registry, harden
downstream.** Not a hard fork (every upstream release would be a competitor's).
Not a pure distribution (we keep a thin, named carry-set: the harness registry,
endpoint removal, the brand, the proof artefacts, dawn grants, Morning Report,
`warding switch`). Offer the registry upstream as an RFC in week 2 (founder
writes it). Rebase onto 0.7.x before Show HN or defer explicitly (gate G-R).
Never promote in Kiro or upstream-project spaces; never imply endorsement; the
upstream product's two-word name is never written in this tree outside the root
NOTICE (say "the upstream project"; the compare page is `/compare/upstream/`);
Kiro never in the product name, tagline, logo or domain; never the Kiro or
Amazon marks in any asset.

## 3. Launch gates

All must be green, with the named evidence, before Show HN.

| Gate | Pass criterion | Owner | Status 2026-09-26 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G0** | Trademark knockout on "Warding" (plus "Warden / AI Warden" phonetic) clean; domain bought; every handle claimed in one hour; "no token or coin" line published. Fallback Keeplit if unclear. | Founder | Open |
| **G1** | Claude Code works on first message with only `claude` on PATH. | Agent | Green on code (the `npx` adapter fallback); re-verify on a clean Mac |
| **G2** | One-line install under 2 minutes on a clean Mac and a clean Ubuntu 24.04 VPS (`pipx install warding` or `uv tool install warding`, prebuilt `static/dist` in the wheel, no clone, no Vite); `temp-screenshots/` out of the tree. | Agent | Open |
| **G3** | A tagged GitHub Release with notes and SHA-256 checksums. | Agent drafts, founder tags | Open; no release exists |
| **G4** | Default build contacts no upstream-owned host; no upstream publisher labels in the UI; the `lsof` run published on `/verified`. | Agent | Green on code; lsof run open |
| **G5** | Every public claim true; the forbidden-claims test passes on the built site; the old site's false copy gone. | Agent drafts, founder approves | Open; site not built |
| **G6** | Measurement: privacy-friendly site analytics, email capture with a working fallback, GitHub traffic export, opt-in beacon to an owned endpoint or none. | Agent, accounts by founder | Open |
| **G7** | Three recorded, unedited Claude Code nights (cron job, one Telegram-approved push, one refused `~/.ssh` read, checkpoint resume, service restart mid-night, `audit verify` green) on a clean Mac mini and a clean VPS, hourly RSS logged, published as dated rows on `/verified`. | Founder records, agent scripts | Open, unrun: no overnight run is verified on any harness. The kill criterion. |
| **G8** | The hero GIF is cut from those recordings, harness and date in frame, never mocked. | Founder records, agent edits | Open |
| **G9** | `/security#scope` states what is enforced where (keystone at the gate plus sandbox; PreToolUse fail-open for pre-authorised tools; computer-use refusals in band; per-OS sandbox table with the exact install line); SECURITY.md updated (acknowledge in 5 business days, bounty scope with safe harbour, upstream-engine reports forwarded to the upstream project's advisory process); the bypass script in the repo with expected output. | Agent drafts, founder signs | Open |
| **G10** | Founder's HN account can post Show HN; Reddit account age and karma checked; GitHub Discussions plus a Discord or Telegram group open; issue templates; "Known limitations" in README. | Founder | Open; issue templates exist |
| **G-R** | Upstream 0.7.x rebased, or explicitly deferred with the decision on `/lineage`. | Agent, founder decides | Open |

## 4. The 90 days, by week

| Week | Dates | Work | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | 09-28 → 10-04 | Founder: G0 (knockout, domain, handles), daily genuine HN comments, decide the fork strategy (rebase now or after launch), stand up Polar and Stripe. Agents: backlog #1 (`warding` console script and rename surfaces), #2 (wheel and one-line install, drop `temp-screenshots/`), #8 (background helpers and model picker off kiro-cli), #9 (sandbox fail-closed UX), start #3 (refusal stamp with SEL line); publish the lsof run; write the G7 night runbook. | G0 G2 G4 G6 |
| **2** | 10-05 → 10-11 | Agents: `warding charter` (#11), `warding audit verify` with export (#12), the bypass script and SECURITY.md rewrite (#13), Astro site v1 with the reserve hero line and every fallback state. Founder: record night 1 on a Mac mini with Claude Code and Telegram; open the upstream registry RFC. Late Desk Setup goes live on Stripe. | G3 G5 G9 |
| **3** | 10-12 → 10-18 | Founder: nights 2 and 3 (VPS with an AppArmor profile; service restart mid-night). Agents: fix what broke; start #4 (MCP tools to spec-family harnesses); generate the `/verified` table from the logs; #7 (hand-raised sprite pose, local-hour sky, time-based tick, draw-once). Private dogfood with 5–10 developers (founder watches, does not coach). Tag v0.6.0-rc. | G7 G1 |
| **4** | 10-19 → 10-25 | Kill check K1. If green: cut the GIF from the recordings, flip the hero to the verified headline, tag v0.6.0, README rewrite, invite two named outside reviewers to run the bypass script (unpaid, credited). Agents: dawn-expiring grants (#5) behind a flag. Founder: commission the Supporter art; write the Show HN text in own words from the fact sheet. | G3 G8 G10 |
| **5** | 10-26 → 11-01 | **Show HN**, Sunday 11-01 at about 16:00 UTC; founder answers for 8 hours; agents monitor issues and hot-fix; no other channel that day. The title names only a harness with a dated night on `/verified`, so Claude Code and not Codex. Lineage in line one of the body. Patch release next day. r/ClaudeCode workflow post with the real Mac-mini transcript (founder). | — |
| **6** | 11-02 → 11-08 | awesome-claude-code form, ACP Clients page PR, awesome-agent-orchestrators PR (founder submits, agents draft). r/ClaudeAI four-part post. Newsletter pitches (Console, TLDR, Changelog News, Self-Host Weekly). Ship dawn grants (#5) and Morning Report v1 (#6). Supporter deliverables land in the private repo; `warding license activate` (#14). | — |
| **7** | 11-09 → 11-15 | **Product Hunt**, Saturday 11-14, no waitlists on the page. r/selfhosted lesson post. Founding Supporter opens on Polar. First ten outbound security or platform-lead conversations begin (founder; opt-in contacts). The pilot page goes live only when the first LOI is signed. | — |
| **8** | 11-16 → 11-22 | V2EX, Juejin, Zenn posts (native speaker rewrites; Feishu and WeCom stated as chat-only with a buttons waitlist). YouTube 6–8 minute walkthrough. "What I learned forking Amazon's open-source agent workspace" write-up (founder voice). Codex night and Goose night recorded: two more `/verified` rows. | — |
| **9** | 11-23 → 11-29 | `/registry` matrix generated from CI (#15). `warding switch` with the carried-over list (#10). Desk Care waitlist goes live if 5 Setups are done. Month-one retro published with real numbers. | — |
| **10** | 11-30 → 12-06 | Pilot #1 kickoff if signed (SIEM forwarding is the first Team feature built). Bi-weekly night-log post format begins (agent drafts from the audit log, founder rewrites). Feishu interactive-card approvals started if the channel-buttons waitlist passes 30. | — |
| **11** | 12-07 → 12-13 | Kill check K3 and K4. Upstream rebase if deferred. Second demo (the switch drill or the morning report) as a new GIF. | G-R |
| **12** | 12-14 → 12-20 | Team companion skeleton (`junction.plugins` entry point; central policy push over the admission trust root) only if a pilot exists. Relaunch on Product Hunt with the version. | — |
| **13** | 12-21 → 12-27 | Day-90 review against sections 5 and 6; decide the next quarter's single channel bet; publish it. | — |

Founder calendar rule: the founder's first 30 days contain exactly three
founder-only items (record the nights, write the Show HN, run the ten
conversations) plus the account actions in [owner-actions.md](owner-actions.md).
Everything else is an agent PR the founder reviews.

## 5. Metrics and targets (scenarios)

| Stage | Metric | Source | Day-30 bad / base / good |
|---|---|---|---|
| Attention | HN points; PH rank; Reddit upvotes | platforms | 20 / 120 / 300 |
| Visit | site sessions by UTM; GitHub views | analytics (G6); GitHub Insights weekly export | 2k / 8k / 20k |
| Intent | install-command copies; Approve-tap on the hero; GitHub clicks | site events | 150 / 600 / 1,500 |
| Stars | GitHub stars (about 1.4 per HN point in 48 h, from the Show HN corpus) | GitHub | 100 / 400 / 1,200 |
| Activation | successful `up` → first agent reply → first channel connected → first scheduled job executed | opt-in beacon (owned); undercounts | 40 / 150 / 400 first replies |
| Retention | weekly-active installs; still active in week 4 | beacon | 15 / 50 / 120 |
| Waitlists | Team; Hosted (with willingness to pay); channel buttons | email capture | 10 / 40 / 120 |
| Revenue (90 days) | Setup × $199; Supporters × $96 (or $8/mo); Pilot × $1,500 | Stripe, Polar | $600 / $1,900 / $4,700 (bad: 2 setups + 2 supporters; base: 4 setups + 8 supporters + 0 pilots; good: 5 setups + 15 supporters + 1 pilot) |
| Quality | install failure rate; median time to first reply; overnight jobs ending in an unreported error; p50 issue response | telemetry, GitHub | under 20% / 10% / 5% install failures; unreported overnight errors under 1 in 5 |

Decision rules: activation under 50% means stop promoting and fix onboarding.
Stars up with actives flat means the demo attracts tourists; move the hero to the
job to be done. Setups selling while nobody asks for governance: see the pivot.
The ledger these are read from is [ledger.csv](ledger.csv); every cell is
`unknown` until its source exists.

## 6. Kill criteria and the pivot

| # | When | Criterion | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Day 10 (end of week 2); hard stop day 30 | No Claude Code night completes unattended on a clean Mac mini without intervention. | Launch waits. No Show HN, no Setup sales for Claude Code users (Setup stays kiro-cli-only), the hero keeps the reserve line, the 07:00 section keeps the real cron calendar. |
| K2 | Day 30 | The trademark knockout on "Warding" returns a live conflict, or upstream ships a rendered policy view plus an overnight digest before Show HN. | Rename to Keeplit before any paid item is listed; differentiation moves to the proof artefacts and dawn grants. |
| K3 | Day 45 | 0 of 10 outbound security or platform leads take a call. | The paid governance layer has no buyer this quarter: the pilot is withdrawn, Team stays a waitlist, money is Setup plus Supporter only. |
| K4 | Day 60 | The Show HN top comment is "fork skin / unaudited" and the founder could not answer with the bypass-script results and `/security#scope` already published. | The honesty apparatus shipped too late; no second launch until it is public and two outside reviewers are credited. |
| K5 | Day 60 | Fewer than 30 weekly-active installs and zero inbound security-lead conversations from `/security`. | Both bets have no signal; freeze feature work, run 20 user interviews, re-plan. |
| K6 | Day 90 | Anthropic un-pauses separate metering of unattended ACP use and no second harness has a recorded night. | Re-lead the hero on Codex, Goose or kiro-cli; Claude Code moves to "supported, metered by Anthropic". |
| K7 | Any day | A public thread shows a page element (screenshot, GIF frame, checkmark) from a harness other than the one the page names. | Pull the asset within the hour; publish the correction on `/verified`. |

**The pivot (K1, K3 or K5).** The night narrative stays as the demo; the brand
stays; the ICP flips fully to the security lead who forwards a packet, with the
indie developer as the free tier that produces screenshots. Paid becomes (a) a
Charter Pack (signed policy templates, the bypass script, audit export, the
fail-closed table, and an hour with the founder) at $199, Available now, and
(b) the pilot with the security buyer's five deliverables as written
preconditions. The Show HN title becomes the mechanism: grants that expire at
07:00. If only K6 trips, the pivot is a harness re-ordering, not a brand change.

The agents check these on schedule and write a tripped criterion to the
[owner inbox](owner-inbox.md); the owner decides.

## 7. Ranked product backlog

Rank is first-run impact times revenue impact. Effort S/M/L. "Gate" means it
must ship before Show HN. The Product role files one issue per row; the code
pointers below are where an implementer starts.

| # | Change | Why | Effort | Gate | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `warding` console script and rename surfaces: primary script, `junction` and older aliases silent; CLI banner; setup wizard headline; README; identity test; both `.agents/skills/*` files. | Brand on first run | S | G0 | `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]`, `src/junction/cli.py`, `src/junction/constants.py`, `test/test_user_facing_identity.py`, `website/src/i18n/locales/*.json` |
| 2 | One-line install, PyPI and npm `warding`, tagged release: wheel with prebuilt `static/dist`, `pipx` or `uv tool install`, checksums; installer script downloads the wheel; `temp-screenshots/` out of the tree and history. Fix red CI first. | HN's "easy to try" rule; the primary CTA label depends on it | M | G2 G3 | `pyproject.toml`, `scripts/get-junction.sh`, `minimal_install.sh`, `.github/workflows/`, `README.md` installer prose |
| 3 | The refusal moment in the UI plus the first upgrade card: seal stamp and SEL line with truncated HMAC on every gate deny; dismissible Team-waitlist card through the contributor seam. | Best screenshot; upgrade moment 1 | S | G8 | `src/junction/hooks.py` (`TOOL_DENY`), `src/junction/sel.py`, `src/junction/platform/defaults.py` (`DefaultDashboardContributor`), the chat tool-call renderer in `website/src/` |
| 4 | Pass Warding's MCP servers to spec-family harnesses so cron from chat, `ask_question`, spawn and memory tools work on Claude Code and Codex, within the harness-parity invariants (adapt, never widen the Kiro path). | Without it a Claude Code user gets a worse product than upstream 0.7.1 | M–L | no; label "from dashboard and CLI" until it lands | `src/junction/acp/client.py` (`_claude_session_mcp_servers`), `src/junction/agent.py`, `docs/system-specs/modules/harness-parity.md`, `scripts/check_harness_parity.py` |
| 5 | Dawn-expiring approval grants: a third choice next to Approve and Deny, "Allow `<tool>` until 07:00", session-scoped, stored on the approval record with the chat identity, expiring at the configured hour, never process-wide; make the process-wide trust grant itself deniable by policy. Rendered on the five button channels and the WhatsApp typed ladder. | The one governance feature no competitor has | M | no (`[COMING]`) | `src/junction/messaging/approval.py` (`_grant_session_trust`), `src/junction/hooks.py`, the channel transports' `max_buttons`, `src/junction/whatsapp/turn_renderer.py`, governance `SCOPE_CATALOG` (a data change, not an evaluator edit) |
| 6 | Morning Report: on first dashboard open after an overnight job or at a configured hour: sessions run, PRs and artifacts, approvals asked and answered, commands refused (from the audit log), secrets redacted, wall time; posted to the owner's channel and as a dashboard card; plus the "desk stopped at 00:10: reason" line so a dead night is reported. | Emotional payload; retention loop; upgrade moment 2 | M | no (the real cron calendar until then) | new `src/junction/morning_report.py`; sources `src/junction/cron.py`, `src/junction/sel.py`, `src/junction/messaging/approval.py`; channel transports; `platform/defaults.py` |
| 7 | Agent Worlds for the web and for truth: hand-raised sprite pose for pending approval; local-hour window sky; time-based tick; draw-once path for reduced motion; integer scaling and crop on phones; brand palette remap; agent chat lines; wallpaper export. | The hero and the GIF | S–M | G8 (partly) | `website/src/pages/scenes/OfficeScene.tsx`, `website/src/hooks/sceneCanvas.ts`, `website/src/hooks/useSceneInteraction.tsx`, `website/src/hooks/sceneText.ts` |
| 8 | Non-Kiro dashboard parity: `GET /api/models` returns the docked harness's advertised set or an honest "this harness picks its own model" state instead of 503; background helpers run on the selected harness via `resolve_usable_model` or degrade quietly; regenerate and rewind un-gated or hidden. | Silent failures read as "broken" on the first run | M | G1 (visible degradation) | `src/junction/dashboard/handlers/agents.py`, `src/junction/session.py` (`get_bg_session`), `src/junction/acp/runtime.py`, `chat_regenerate.py`, `chat_rewind.py` |
| 9 | Sandbox fail-closed UX: one-screen explanation with the exact install line on Ubuntu 23.10 and later, containers without user namespaces, and Windows (not macOS 26, where Seatbelt works and is probed); Settings → Security shows the per-OS table; never weaken the default. | Second most common first-run failure; the VPS guide targets it | S | G9 | `src/junction/sandbox.py`, `docs/guides/install.md`, `src/junction/security_posture.py` |
| 10 | `warding switch <runtime>`: validates the runtime is installed, sets `agent.acp_backend`, drains and restarts sessions, runs a smoke prompt, prints the carried-over list (memory rows, crons, skills, channels, policy hash). | The portability proof point; upgrade moment 5 | M | no | `src/junction/cli.py`, `src/junction/config/loader.py` (`_normalize_acp_backend`), `src/junction/planes.py`, `src/junction/snapshot.py` |
| 11 | `warding charter` (CLI and dashboard page): renders `security_policy.json`, `profiles/` and the effective POLICY ∩ PROFILE per tool as numbered articles; exports Markdown and PDF for auditors. | The brand's central artefact; the pilot's sales deck | S–M | G9 | `src/junction/security.py` (`_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`), `src/junction/hooks.py`, `src/junction/security_posture.py`, `docs/system-specs/modules/governance.md` |
| 12 | `warding audit verify`: prints the audit-chain status in one command; `--export json/csv`; SIEM and OTel forwarding is the first Team feature. | Makes "chained log" checkable in ten seconds | S | G9 | `src/junction/sel.py` (also drop the internal standard citation) |
| 13 | SECURITY.md rewrite plus the "break the charter" script: ten reproducible attempts to read, write, `sed`, symlink, `tar` and `python -c open()` the keystone with expected output; scope is the keystone bypass; documented fail-open paths listed as out of scope with issue links; safe-harbour language; one payout per quarter (amount signed by the owner); acknowledge within 5 business days; upstream-engine reports forwarded to the upstream project's advisory process. | Trust block at 0 stars; the answer to "unaudited" | S | G9 | `SECURITY.md`, `test/test_denied_commands_security.py`, `docs/architecture/security-deep-dive.md` |
| 14 | Founding Supporter deliverables plus `warding license activate`: The Vault scene on the 440×300 engine (ships in the product, gated by key), the theme pack, the numbered seal badge from a Polar license key (key plus org id, no secret). | Polar checkout cannot open until they exist | M (2–5 days art) | no | `website/src/pages/scenes/config.tsx`, `docs/system-specs/modules/themes.md`, `platform/discovery.py` (`junction.plugins`) |
| 15 | `/registry` and `/verified` from CI: an e2e job per harness (Claude Code, Codex, Goose first) that seeds memory, fires a cron, round-trips a Telegram approval and logs a refusal; writes a dated matrix with honest "unverified" rows the site renders. | Replaces every "any agent" claim with a table | M–L | no | `docs/ci/harness-parity-gate.md`, `scripts/check_harness_parity.py`, `test/`, `src/junction/context.py` |
| 16 | Approve buttons on Feishu (interactive cards) and WeCom (template cards); typed approvals on iMessage. Planned, not started; the waitlist sets the order. | The Asia channels are chat-only today | M / S | no | `src/junction/feishu/`, `src/junction/wecom/`, `src/junction/imessage/`, `messaging/approval.py` (`TextReplyApprovalDecider`) |
| 17 | Multi-approver sets per channel, per-channel policy profiles, audit-log webhook forwarding (the pilot build). | The product is single-owner; the pilot is unsellable without it | L | no (pilot-funded) | `src/junction/messaging/identity.py`, `messaging/session_trust.py`, `platform/admission.py`, `platform/defaults.py` (`DefaultIdentityProvider`), `sel.py` |
| 18 | RSS under load measured (three sessions plus embeddings plus subagents) on an 8 GB Mac mini and a 4 GB VPS; published on `/security` and in README "Known limitations". Idle is 452 MB, measured; the 10 GB figure was never measured for Warding. | Kills the 10 GB myth or confirms it; gates the hosted question | S | G7 (part of the nights) | `src/junction/cloud/sizes.py` |

Gates: #1, #2, #3, #8, #9, #11, #12, #13 plus the nights before Show HN. #4,
#5, #6, #7 make the brand true. #10, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18 make the revenue
true.

## 8. Owner-only actions and the team

Owner-only actions, dated: [owner-actions.md](owner-actions.md). Items the
agents raise as they go: [owner-inbox.md](owner-inbox.md). The six roles, their
envelope and their Routine prompts:
[`.agents/business/README.md`](../../.agents/business/README.md). Weekly status:
[status/](status/README.md).

Escalation to the owner, always: any spend, any date promised to a customer,
any security report, any public correction, any change to SECURITY.md, pricing
or terms, any request to post, and any kill criterion that trips.
