# Owner-only actions

The standing checklist of things only the owner can do. The agents prepare,
draft, and remind; they never spend, sign, post, create an account, hold a
credential, or record a night. Dates follow the [plan](plan.md), whose day 1 is
Monday 2026-09-28. Items that come up between these go to the
[owner inbox](owner-inbox.md). The CEO review reads this file every Monday.

Status values: open, done (with the date), or dropped (with the reason).

## Week 1 (09-28 → 10-04): the name, the accounts, the measurement

| Due | Action | Why owner-only | Prepared by the agents | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09-30 | **Trademark knockout** on "Warding" and "Warding Labs", classes 9 and 42, USPTO TESS and EUIPO, plus the phonetic cluster "Warden / AI Warden" (aiwarden.com, aiwarden.ai, ai-warden.io, wardengateway.com, agentic-warden exist in the same field). Ideally a 30-minute attorney read. Look at `warding.com` by hand. Decide Warding versus the fallback Keeplit by day 3. | Legal judgement and possible spend | The availability table in the brand book: `.dev`, PyPI and npm read as free on 2026-09-26; Keeplit and Lampkeep checked as fallbacks | open |
| 09-30, the same hour | **Buy `warding.dev`**; `.run` if free once the RDAP rate limit clears; `.sh` and `.so` at a registrar. Keep `getjunction.dev` registered and 301 it path-for-path. | Spend | The redirect map is the site spec's route table | open |
| 09-30, the same hour | **Claim the handles**: GitHub organisation `warding` (or `warding-dev`) and rename `laqaer/junction` to `<org>/warding` (GitHub redirects the old slug); npm `warding`; PyPI `warding`; X; Reddit; Product Hunt; Discord; YouTube. Publish "Warding has no token or coin" the same hour. | Identity and accounts | The "no token" line; the list of surfaces that hardcode the slug (installer script remotes, README) for the engineering loop to update | open |
| 10-02 | **Polar organisation**: confirm in writing with Polar that a supporter tier whose future features are labelled "in development" is not a pre-order, before checkout opens. Create the Founding Supporter product (annual and monthly) but keep it unpublished until both deliverables ship. | Account, money, terms | `pricing.md` rows 3 and 5; the benefit list (license key, private repo, Discord role) | open |
| 10-02 | **Stripe account**: tax registration; a Payment Link for Late Desk Setup ($199, with the written scope and the full-refund term); Invoicing for pilots. | Account, money, tax | `pricing.md` rows 2 and 4; the setup runbook and pilot packet (Revenue creates them) | open |
| 10-02 | **GitHub Sponsors profile** for tips. | Account | — | open |
| 10-02 | **Cal.com** (or equivalent) booking page for Setup sessions and pilot calls, linked from the pricing page once it exists. | Account | The booking-page copy in the setup runbook | open |
| 10-04 | **Analytics** account (Plausible or Umami) and its script domain; **waitlist endpoint** (Formspree, Buttondown, or a Vercel function; or accept the GitHub Discussions fallback); **Google Search Console** and **Bing Webmaster** once the domain resolves. | Accounts, spend | The event names the site spec defines; the UTM scheme | open |
| 10-04 | **Create the `business/*` labels** once on the repository (`business/ceo-review`, `business/growth`, `business/community`, `business/product`, `business/revenue`, `business/honesty-auditor`), alongside the existing `agent-os/*` set. | Repository admin | The label list in the charter | open |
| daily from 09-29 | **HN account**: genuine comments, not about the product, every day; confirm the account is allowed to post Show HN. **Reddit account**: check age and karma against each community's norms. | Identity | The community rules table in the launch kit | open |
| 10-04 | **Fork strategy decision**: rebase onto upstream 0.7.x before Show HN, or defer with the decision written on `/lineage` (gate G-R). | Strategic decision | The plan's section 2 | open |
| 10-04 | **Approve the prices and labels** in `pricing.md` in writing. | Every price | `pricing.md` | open |
