"""check_brand_name.py — gate the retired upstream identity on lines a change adds.

Warding started as a fork, and the upstream product's identity is **retired**,
not misspelled: no system in this tree still owns any of its spellings. The CLI,
the Python package, the environment prefix, the data home, the download and
update hosts, the bundle id, the repository slug and the mascot all moved to
this product's own (``warding`` and the ``junction`` alias, ``JUNCTION_*``,
``~/.junction``, ``warding.dev``, ``dev.junction.desktop``, ``laqaer/junction``,
the Ward Seal). So every rendering of the old identity is residue, in prose
and in identifiers alike, and this gate reports each one:

* the upstream two-word product name in any case, with its words glued or
  joined by one joiner: whitespace, ``_``, ``-``, ``.``, ``+``, ``/``, ``\\``
  (escaped or not), a Unicode dash or zero-width character, ``%20``,
  ``&nbsp;``, or a regex spelling of a joiner -- an escape (``\\-``, ``\\s``,
  ``\\W``), a short character class (``[/_]``, ``[\\s_-]``) or a short group
  (``(?:-|_)``), optionally made optional with ``?`` or ``*`` (see
  ``_JOINER``). That one family spans the prose name, the CLI and package
  spellings, the environment prefix, and the retired data home beside
  kiro-cli's directory;
* the retired data home INSIDE kiro-cli's directory, both as one path literal
  (either separator, escaped or not, or a regex class or group of the two) and
  as code builds it: the directory and the second word as two string literals
  joined by a path operator, a comma, a ``+`` or ``joinpath``, or around an
  ``os.sep`` / ``path.sep`` interpolation;
* hosts under the retired product domain (its ``download.``, ``updates.`` and
  ``apps.`` subdomains all carry it), with dots plain, regex-escaped or written
  as ``[.]``;
* the retired Apple bundle id, its dots spelled the same ways;
* the upstream GitHub organisation, except where it cites kiro-cli's own public
  repository (see ``_KIRO_CLI_REPO``). Every other use -- a slug with any other
  repository, the container namespace, the ``-labs`` registry, an owner check
  -- is flagged, and a slug naming the retired product also reports the name;
* the upstream ghost mascot's component name.

What the gate leaves alone is kiro-cli, the harness Warding drives: its own
home ``~/.kiro`` and kiro-cli's own directories in it (``~/.kiro/settings``,
``~/.kiro/agents``), ``kiro-cli``, ``Kiro CLI``, ``ACP_BACKEND_KIRO``, the
``kiro.dev`` documentation site, and citations of kiro-cli's own repository
under the organisation above. The generic word ``crew`` on its own is not the
upstream identity either, and neither are the two words when clause
punctuation (``. ``, ``, ``, ``? ``) separates them.

## The one exemption

``NOTICE`` at the repository root. Apache-2.0 section 4(d) requires a
derivative work to keep the attribution notices of the work it derives from,
so that file must name the upstream product. It is exempt by path and by
nothing else: there is no inline suppression marker, because the retired
identity has no other legitimate home and a marker would let residue opt itself
back in.

## Why diff-scoped and not whole-tree

The enforcing check reads only the lines the change *adds* (``BRAND_BASE_REF``),
which is complete for regression: a line can only reach ``main`` through a diff
that added it. Residue that predates the rename never becomes the build break
of whoever pushed next; the whole-tree count is printed instead, as a
non-failing report, so it stays visible until it is gone.

## Usage

    # enforce on what this branch adds (exit 1 on any violation)
    BRAND_BASE_REF=origin/main python3 scripts/check_brand_name.py

    # report the whole-tree residue, enforce nothing (exit 0)
    python3 scripts/check_brand_name.py

    # scan explicit files, ignoring git entirely (exit 1 on any violation)
    python3 scripts/check_brand_name.py README.md docs/foo.md

    # self-test: plant one probe per rule family, assert each verdict
    python3 scripts/check_brand_name.py --test

This file and its tests assemble every retired spelling from fragments, so both
are scanned like any other file and neither carries the identity they hunt.

# What may join the two words of a retired name: nothing, or ONE joiner, which is

# * one or two whitespace characters (a space, a tab, a no-break space, a
#   doubled space);
# * one or two of ``_ + / -``, a Unicode hyphen or dash, a soft hyphen, or a
#   zero-width character. None of these is whitespace, so none can end a
#   sentence;
# * a single ``.``, never followed by anything else. A dot followed by a space
#   is a sentence boundary: a sentence that ends on the harness's name, followed
#   by one that opens with the generic word, names kiro-cli and then a crew, not
#   the retired product;
# * one to four backslashes, optionally followed by one of `` .sSwW_+/-`` (a
#   Windows path, the same path escaped inside a string literal, a
#   shell-escaped space, a Markdown-escaped underscore, a JSON-escaped slash, a
#   regex-escaped joiner, or a regex class such as ``\s`` or ``\W``);
# * ``%20`` (a URL-encoded space) or ``&nbsp;`` (an HTML one);

#   ``[\\/]`` or ``[\s_-]``;
# * a short regex group, such as ``(?:-|_)`` or ``(\s|-)``. Its contents are
#   only bounded, not inspected: the name's two words never sit either side of a

# the name (the name with `` ?`` between its words) is reported as the name too.
# Punctuation that separates clauses (``,``, ``;``, ``!``, ``?`` followed by a
# space) is not a joiner, so two words that merely sit next to each other in
# prose are never joined into the name.

    # absolute threshold generous enough for a loaded CI runner is also generous
    # enough to let a quadratic implementation pass at this size.

    # Measuring a ratio puts the whole burden on the timer, so it measures CPU
    # time, which does not advance while the thread is off-CPU. Wall clock does
    # not work: `time.monotonic()` is `GetTickCount64()` on Windows, a ~15.625ms
    # tick that quantises a short sample by a large fraction of itself, and when
    # xdist workers oversubscribe the runner the LONGER scan absorbs more
    # preemption than the shorter one, which inflates the ratio systematically.
    # Pairing each baseline with its own doubled sample keeps the two halves of a
    # ratio from the same conditions. Under 2x CPU oversubscription a linear scan
    # stays at most ~2x while a quadratic one never drops below ~3.9x, so the 3.0x
