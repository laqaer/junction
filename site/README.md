# Warding marketing site

Astro 7 static site (React islands only where interaction needs them), served by
Vercel from this directory. Every page is prerendered HTML.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev          # astro dev
npm run build        # astro check && astro build  -> dist/
npm test             # builds, then runs the dist/ suites
```

Node ≥ 22.12. All dependencies are `devDependencies` (nothing ships at runtime).

## Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/data/site.ts` | The one config object: domain, repo, version, feature flags, checkout and waitlist links. `""` renders a named "coming soon" state, never a broken link. The owner flips `domain` when the new one is live. |
| `src/data/channels.ts`, `harnesses.ts`, `pricing.ts`, `nav.ts` | The ten channels with their honest approval mode, the ten runtimes with verified flags, the seven offers with labels and rails, the nav and footer. Pages read these; do not restate the facts in copy. |
| `src/content/{compare,guides,channels}/*.mdx` | Content collections. Frontmatter is schema-validated (`src/content.config.ts`): `title` ≤ 60, `description` ≤ 155, `h1`, `ogRegister`, `verified` rows with ISO dates. A bad field fails the build. |
| `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` | Head (title, description, canonical, OG/Twitter, theme-color both schemes, JSON-LD slot), skip link, landmarks, reveal script. |
| `src/layouts/PageLayout.astro` | Inner pages: `{title, description, h1, register, breadcrumbs, lead}`. |
| `src/components/` | Astro, zero-JS: `Nav`, `Footer`, `WardSeal`, `WardBars`, `StatusChip` (icon + word, never colour-only), `Plate` (a `figure[data-shot]` whose caption must carry harness + date), `PhoneCard`, `CharterSheet`, `ClockHead`, `Button`, `LinkButton`, `FaqItem`. |
| `src/islands/` | React: `InstallTabs`, `ApproveFromChatDemo`, `WaitlistForm` (fallback chain of site-spec §10), `world/OfficeWorld` (the product's Office renderer, ported as a pure module in `world/office.ts`), `world/Drollery`. |
| `src/lib/og.ts` + `src/pages/og/[...slug].png.ts` | Build-time OG PNGs (satori + resvg). Collection entries get one automatically; a static page must be listed in `src/lib/og-pages.ts`. |
| `src/assets/shots/` | Real dashboard captures, same filenames as the capture manifest so they can be overwritten in place. Compressed to AVIF/WebP at build by `<Plate>`. |
| `public/fonts/` | Departure Mono (OFL, licence alongside). Fraunces, IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono come from Fontsource. No Google Fonts. |
| `tests/` | `claims.test.ts` (the forbidden-claims list), `structure.test.ts` (head tags, landmarks, sitemap, robots, alt text, pause controls), `brand.test.ts`. They run over `dist/`. |

## Adding a page

1. Prefer a collection entry: drop `src/content/<collection>/<slug>.mdx` with the
   schema's frontmatter. Route, sitemap entry, OG image and `llms.txt` line appear
   automatically.
2. For a static page, use `PageLayout`, add the page to `src/lib/og-pages.ts`
   (slug rule: `/compare/paseo/` → `compare-paseo`), and keep the title ≤ 60 and
   description ≤ 155 (the layout throws otherwise).
3. Status is icon + word (`StatusChip`), never colour alone. Every screenshot goes
   through `<Plate>` with the manifest caption. Links from `site.ts` that are `""`
   render their coming-soon state.
4. Run `npm test`. The claims suite is the honesty gate: every phrase in
   site-spec §11 fails the build, including the upstream product's two-word name in
   any spelling. Write "Amazon's open-source Kiro agent workspace" and link NOTICE.

## Theme mechanics

Tokens live on `:root` (paper), are redefined under
`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` guarded by `:root:not([data-theme="light"])`,
again under `:root[data-theme="dark"]`, and locally inside any `.vault` wrapper
(night sections on a paper page). The toggle persists to `localStorage`
(`warding.theme`) inside try/catch.
