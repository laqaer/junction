"""User-facing identity is Warding, and the README obeys the forbidden-claims list.

The product name, the CLI name, the tagline and the lineage line are pinned
here because a rename that misses one surface ships a stale name silently.
The README assertions mirror the site's forbidden-claims list: a phrase
another company headlines with, a claim that is not true on this tree, or a
number nobody measured must not appear. The upstream product's retired
identity is asserted absent from every public surface as well.
