"""The app install/update metadata reads and writes stay off the event loop.

An app install or update reads and writes small metadata files. ``get_app``
reads ``installed.json`` and ``app.json``. ``register_external_app`` registers a
self-managed app, and ``set_app_provenance`` records the source the app came
from. The local install route also resolves the source path and reads its
manifest. Each call is short, but on a stalled filesystem it blocks in the
kernel. On the loop thread that freezes every task, including the liveness
heartbeat, until the loop-stall watchdog kills the gateway. So each async caller
hands these calls to a worker thread.

The guards use the two tiers of ``test_apps_instances_loop_offload.py``:

- Behavior tests: each async entry point runs with recording doubles in place
  of the metadata functions, or with a ``Path`` class that records each call and
  then does the real filesystem work. A double records the thread it runs on, so
  a direct call records the loop thread and fails the test.
- AST ratchet: no direct call of a moved function may appear in an
  ``async def`` frame of ``registry.py``. A nested ``def`` that the frame calls
  directly counts as part of the frame. Other ``routes.py`` handlers still call
  ``get_app`` on the loop, so the ``routes.py`` check covers only the install
  and update handler frames.

``install_from_registry`` runs under its caller's ``app_lifecycle_lock``. The
last tests cancel an install during a metadata write. The install must not
unwind, and so release that lock, until the write is done.
