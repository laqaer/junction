"""``AcpClient.shutdown()`` must reset its state even when the kill fails.

``shutdown`` awaited ``_kill_process(force=True)`` and then called
``_reset_state()`` sequentially, so any exception out of the kill skipped the
reset entirely.

``_kill_process`` has several exits: four ``run_in_executor`` awaits (child
scan, record capture, escaped-child sweep) that are not individually guarded,
``subprocess_executor()`` refusing new work once the loop is tearing down, and
``asyncio.CancelledError`` -- a ``BaseException`` -- arriving mid-await, which
is precisely what a shutdown produces.

Nothing retries. Every caller treats ``shutdown`` as terminal and drops the
client right after: ``AcpWorker`` (``knowledge/llm_pool.py``) and
``_shutdown_quietly`` (``connections/mint.py``) both ``except Exception``, log,
and set their reference to ``None``. So a skipped reset is permanent.

The effect asserted here is the one with a security shape: for the claude
backend ``_reset_state`` reverts the ``.claude/settings.local.json`` that the
session's settings seed wrote, which exists only to carry ``bypassPermissions``
for the live session. The same file is also the USER's own per-project Claude
Code config, so the second half of this module pins the other direction: a file
this client never wrote is never touched. These tests use a real work directory
and a real file rather than asserting a mock was called.
