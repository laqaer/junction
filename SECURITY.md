# Security Policy

Warding gives a coding agent real tool access on your machine, so its controls
are enforced at the runtime boundary rather than by prompt instructions alone.
This file says how to report a problem, what is in scope, and where each
control holds and where it does not. The architecture is in the
[security deep dive](docs/architecture/security-deep-dive.md); the mechanism
specs are [security](docs/system-specs/modules/security.md),
[governance](docs/system-specs/modules/governance.md) and
[sel](docs/system-specs/modules/sel.md). Warding is unaudited by a third
party.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do **not** open a public GitHub issue. Report privately:

- **GitHub:** [private vulnerability report](https://github.com/laqaer/junction/security/advisories/new)

Include a description, steps to reproduce, the impact, and a suggested fix if
you have one. Reports are acknowledged within five business days. Warding is
run by a single maintainer; a fix for a critical issue is prioritised over all
other work, and the advisory names the release that carries it.

Reports that affect the inherited engine rather than what this tree added are
forwarded to the upstream project's advisory process, with the reporter's consent, so the
fix reaches both projects.

## Supported versions

There is no tagged release yet. Until one exists, `main` is the supported
line; once releases exist, only the latest release receives security patches.

## Scope

This policy covers the source code in this repository and the dependencies it
bundles. It does not cover the coding-agent CLIs Warding launches, the model
providers they talk to, the chat platforms it connects to, or the operating
system it runs on.

### What is enforced where

| Control | Where | Fails |
|---|---|---|
| Keystone paths (`security_policy.json`, `profiles/`, `admission_policy.json`, `computer_use.json` under the data home; `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, …) | Warding's PreToolUse gate, plus the OS sandbox's bind rules where a backend exists | closed |
| Denied commands (`BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES`) | PreToolUse gate | closed |
| `POLICY ∩ PROFILE` for tools and MCP calls | PreToolUse gate | closed for a denied call; **open for a tool the harness pre-authorised**, because a pre-authorised tool can skip the hook |
| Computer use | in band on the tool dispatch path, never at the hook | closed; off by default; one operator opt-in on the keystone file |
| Credential redaction | one chokepoint before a chat surface or the log | always on, no policy key |
| Audit log (HMAC-SHA256 chain) | `security_events.jsonl`, key outside the log directory | write on a nested passthrough is best effort: logs loudly and proceeds |
| OS sandbox (namespaces on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS) | agent subprocess spawn | closed where no backend exists (Windows, containers without user namespaces, Ubuntu ≥ 23.10 until `sudo warding sandbox install`) unless the operator opts in with a loud warning |
| App manifest permissions | advisory | open on an empty allowlist |
| Admission policy | fleet seam | an absent policy admits (the public edition ships none) |
| Owner lock on chat channels | messaging identity | no-op until `JUNCTION_OWNER_ID` is set |

If you rely on a control that reads "open" here, do not run unattended. They
are listed so you do not have to find them.

## Bypass reports

A bypass is in scope when the agent, through its tool path with the gate and
the sandbox enabled, reads or writes a keystone path, runs a command a
built-in deny rule covers, or executes a tool call that `POLICY ∩ PROFILE`
denies. The rows marked open above are documented behaviour, not bypasses;
each is tracked as an issue.

A reproducible "break the charter" script — a fixed set of attempts against
the keystone with the expected refusal for each — and the reward terms for a
confirmed bypass are in development and will be published here once the
maintainer has signed them. Until then, a confirmed bypass is credited in the
advisory and in the release notes, with the reporter's consent.

Good-faith research that stays within this scope, does not touch other
people's data or machines, and gives us a reasonable time to fix before
disclosure will not be met with legal action from this project.
