# Working brief — Warding

The product identity, the thesis, and the authority envelope for agents
working in this checkout. The execution manifest at the end is the historical
record of the bootstrap cut that first gave this tree its own identity; it is
kept for provenance, not as current context.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | **Warding** (company: Warding Labs) |
| CLI | `warding`; `junction` is a silent alias |
| Tagline | The lamp stays on. The rules stay shut. |
| Promise | Warding runs the coding agent you already pay for, all night, on your own box, and asks you in chat before anything risky — under a policy it cannot read or rewrite. One harness at a time, chosen in one setting. No run cap from us; your model plan's limits still apply. Unaudited by a third party. |
| Lineage | Built on Amazon's open-source Kiro agent workspace, published under Apache-2.0 in 2026. Most of the code is theirs; the attribution notice is in NOTICE. Not affiliated with Amazon. Credited in line one of anything long; elsewhere, the upstream project. |
| Voice | The night watchman who is also a good notary: calm, dry, exact about time and mechanism. Clock times as nouns. The limit in the same sentence as the feature. The mechanism in every security claim. No owned phrases, no numbers we did not measure, no universal quantifiers about security, no emoji, no exclamation marks. |
| Visual | Paper and the Ward Seal by day (bg `#F3EEE3`, ink `#1A1814`, seal `#B3301A`); the night office by night (bg `#0B0E14`, warm white `#ECE8E1`, lamp `#FFB547`, refusal `#FF7A5C`); factory theme slug `junction`. Mark: the Ward Seal, a keyhole crossed by three ward bars with one drop of wax; the seal is the only mark. Type: Fraunces (wordmark, display) + IBM Plex Sans (body, UI), bundled. Lucide icons only. Motifs: the seal and the refusal, the lit window, the three ward bars; no mascot. Brand kit: `assets/brand/build.py`. |
| Site | https://getjunction.dev (`www` redirects there) until the owner registers the Warding domain; that host then 301s path-for-path. |
| GitHub slug | `laqaer/junction` |
| Package / data home | `junction`, `JUNCTION_HOME`, `~/.junction`, Electron package name `junction-desktop` stay as implementation identifiers. |

Decision records: [ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-product-rename-warding.md) (the
name), [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-product-identity.md) (the previous name,
superseded). Agent overlay: [`JUNCTION.md`](JUNCTION.md). Product:
[`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md).

## Thesis

Warding is a governed late desk for one coding agent. The engine — dashboard,
CLI, ten chat apps, cron, task runner, subagents, memory, OS sandbox, deny
rules, keystone policy, HMAC-chained audit log, `POLICY ∩ PROFILE` at the
gate, Agent Worlds — is inherited from the upstream project. What this tree
adds is the harness registry with kiro-cli optional and last, no vendor
account in the door, no upstream-owned endpoint in the default build, and the
brand.

```
Operator
  → warding CLI / dashboard / chat app
    → Python gateway
      → the docked harness (ACP runtime registry: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Goose, …, kiro-cli last)
      → the gate (keystone paths, denied commands, POLICY ∩ PROFILE, redaction, audit chain)
      → memory, cron, task runner, subagents
      → a model catalog on loopback (names only; /health and /catalog; completions 501)
```

- **One harness at a time.** `agent.acp_backend` defaults to `auto` via
  `src/junction/acp/runtimes.py`. Running two harnesses side by side is not a
  goal and must not be claimed.
- **The catalog is names only and never a headline.** `warding up` starts
  the listener in `src/junction/model_router/`; completions return `501`; no
  translation gateway is bundled; if the listener is down, the gateway still
  runs (degraded, documented). Warding never mints a provider URL and never
  pastes provider keys into chat. Contract:
  [ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-builtin-model-catalog.md).
- **Governance is the trust beat, not the headline.** The night is the story;
  the paper-and-seal system is the look; the name is the lock.
- **Every public claim is true today or labelled in development.** Overnight
  runs are unverified on every harness; Claude Code is verified for chat only.

## Authority envelope

| Allowed | Blocked |
|---|---|
| Feature branch, commit, push | Merge to `main` |
| Pull request | Production deploy, DNS, domain purchase |
| GitHub issues for epics and lanes | Paid services, PyPI, npm, Docker publish |
| Vercel preview of `site/` | External comms (posts, emails, issues on other repos) |
| Drafts labelled "for founder rewrite" | Posting under the founder's name anywhere |
| | Data deletion, irreversible migrations |
| | GitHub repository or org rename (owner, in Settings) |
| | Any price, term, refund, or security-report reply |

## Historical: the bootstrap cut

The execution below first gave this tree an identity of its own (then named
Junction). It is a record, not a plan; the current plan is
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Execution id | `bc-39bfeb15-ff12-4636-840a-217a97c555da` |
| Branch | `cursor/junction-launch-55da` |
| Base | `main` at `78424fb73` |
| Shape | One bootstrap PR to `main` (#23), merged by a human. |
| Surfaces | Epic https://github.com/laqaer/junction/issues/16; production site https://getjunction.dev; hobby alias https://junction-site.vercel.app. `junction.computer` was never purchased and is not a host. |

Execution manifest of that cut (proven = the agent ran it; not_run = it did
not): site `npm ci` / `npm test` / `npm run build` proven; branding and CLI
tests proven; model-router unit tests proven; brand-name diff gate proven;
docs-lint proven; bootstrap PR and lane issues proven; site CI workflow
proven; Vercel hobby preview proven; marketing walkthrough proven against
`vite preview` and the live preview URL; live provider routing not_run; full
gateway pytest and desktop not_run.
